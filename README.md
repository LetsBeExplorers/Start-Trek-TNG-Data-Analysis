# Start-Trek-TNG-Data-Analysis

In Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG), Data is an android who dreams of becoming more human over time. The information I aim to determine is whether Data's speech patterns in TNG actually become more "human-like" over time. I am hypothesizing that if Data's speech patterns do indeed become more human, than his word variability should increase over time.

Word Variability will be tested by how many different words Data uses per episode, and how often he uses the same words (i.e. the distribution). Linear regression will be performed on the distributions to determine if the overall trend is increasing, decreasing, or neither.
